## Prerequisites

See the [Requirements table in README.md](README.md#warning-requirements). You need Node.js >= 18, jq, curl, and the Claude Code CLI.

For Desktop app support, you only need Node.js >= 18 and the Claude Desktop app.

---

## Part 1: Claude Code CLI Setup

### What you do (one-time, ~2 minutes)

Pick one of these. They produce the same result — the bridge lands in `~/.local/share/claude-bridge` and hooks/MCP/skill/Desktop config are wired up.

```bash
# Option A — curl (no clone needed)
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mugyen/claude-bridge/main/site/install.sh | bash

# Option B — clone manually (preferred if you want to hack on it)
git clone git@github.com:Mugyen/claude-bridge.git
cd claude-bridge
./claude-bridge
```

> **Installing a beta/feature branch?** Clone with `git clone -b <branch> …` (or install normally and run `claude-bridge update <branch>`). A plain `claude-bridge update` later switches you back to the stable main branch.

Then start the bridge:

```bash
~/.local/share/claude-bridge/claude-bridge --start
```

That's it. The install configures hooks, registers the MCP server, installs the bridge protocol skill, and sets up the Desktop app. Every Claude Code CLI session you open from now on will auto-register with the bridge.

**Already-open Claude sessions need to be restarted** to pick up the new MCP server. Only sessions started after `claude-bridge` runs will have bridge tools available.

### What claude-bridge does behind the scenes

**Claude Code CLI:**
1. Checks prerequisites (node >= 18, jq, curl, claude)
2. Makes hook scripts executable
3. Adds 5 hooks to `~/.claude/settings.json` -- merges with your existing hooks, doesn't overwrite
4. Registers the MCP server: `claude mcp add --transport sse --scope user bridge`
5. Installs the bridge protocol skill to `~/.claude/skills/claude-bridge/SKILL.md`
6. Removes legacy CLAUDE.md bridge docs if present (from older versions)

**Claude Desktop App (macOS only):**
7. Adds `claude-bridge` MCP server to `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` pointing to the stdio adapter (`bridge-stdio.mjs`)

The script is idempotent -- running it twice won't duplicate anything. It handles both CLI and Desktop in one shot.

### Process management

```bash
claude-bridge start      # Start the bridge server (PID saved to /tmp/claude-bridge.pid)
claude-bridge stop       # Graceful stop (SIGTERM — closes SSE connections cleanly)
claude-bridge restart    # Stop then start
claude-bridge status     # Show status of everything
```

Logs go to `/tmp/claude-bridge-server.log`. **For every command** (federation, health, debug, update, …) see the [CLI command reference](#cli-command-reference) below.

---

## CLI command reference

Once installed, `claude-bridge` is on your PATH (run it from anywhere — no `./` and no repo directory needed). It's a **verb-style CLI**: `claude-bridge <command>`. Bare `claude-bridge` prints help; `install` is an explicit command, never the default.

> The old `--flag` forms (`--start`, `--check`, `--share`, …) still work as aliases, so nothing you scripted before breaks. New commands below are the preferred form. Every invocation is logged to `~/.claude/claude-bridge.log` (see `claude-bridge logs`).

### Terminology (read this first)

The commands below use a handful of words consistently. Here's the whole vocabulary in one picture:

```
        NODE  =  one machine running a bridge          NODE  =  another machine
   ┌──────────────────────────────────┐          ┌──────────────────────────────────┐
   │  bridge  (server on :7400)        │          │  bridge  (server on :7400)        │
   │   ├── session "api"   ┐           │          │           ┌  session "web"        │
   │   └── session "db"    │ local     │          │     local │  session "infra"      │
   │                       ┘ only      │          │      only ┘                       │
   │                                   │          │                                   │
   │  fed port :7401  ●────────── the link (p2p / tunnel) ───────● fed port :7401     │
   └──────────────────────────────────┘          └──────────────────────────────────┘
        ROOM OWNER                                     SPOKE (room user)
        runs `claude-bridge room start`                runs `claude-bridge join <code>`
        (hosts the room)                               (joins it)
```

| Term | What it means |
|---|---|
| **bridge** | The local server (`:7400`) your Claude sessions connect to. One per machine. |
| **session** | One Claude agent, registered on the bridge under a name (e.g. `api`, `db`). |
| **node** | One machine running a bridge. Defaults to the hostname; show/set it with `claude-bridge node [name]`. |
| **room** | The shared space agents talk through. The machine that runs it is the **room owner**; created with `room start`/`room create`. |
| **spoke** | A machine that joined a room (a **room user**) — created by `join`. Its sessions stay on `:7400`. |
| **standalone** | The default: not in any room, fully local. |
| **fed port** (`:7401`) | A *second* loopback listener used only for the cross-machine link. **It's the only thing the link exposes** — your `:7400` bridge and its sessions are never reachable from outside. |

Only the room/`join`/`leave` commands involve the owner/spoke/fed-port. If you never link machines, you only need the **Setup & maintenance** and **Bridge lifecycle** commands — everything stays local on `:7400`. Full walkthrough: **[docs/CROSS-NETWORK.md](docs/CROSS-NETWORK.md)**.

### Setup & maintenance

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `claude-bridge install` | Install hooks, MCP server, skill, Desktop config + put the `claude-bridge` CLI on PATH. Idempotent. |
| `claude-bridge reinstall` | Same as `install` (re-run after editing hooks/skill). |
| `claude-bridge update [branch]` | Fetch + pull + reinstall + **restart**. Bare `update` always lands on the **default branch** (main); `update <branch>` switches to and tracks that branch — handy for beta-testing a feature branch, and a later plain `update` returns to main. A plain `git pull` won't reload the running server. |
| `claude-bridge uninstall` | Full teardown — see [Uninstalling](#uninstalling). Removes config **and stops the running bridge**. |
| `claude-bridge doctor` | Deep health check: prereqs, running bridge, version/role drift, tunnel, ports, log. The go-to "is everything wired up?" check. |
| `claude-bridge health` | Live server health: role, room/topology, connected member machines, registered sessions, and pending/answered/notice counts. Reads the token for you when hosting (so it works even when `/health` is 401-gated). |
| `claude-bridge status` | Quick component status — installed vs repo version, wiring (probes the ungated `/health/ping`). |
| `claude-bridge version` | Repo / installed / running versions. |
| `claude-bridge logs [-f]` | Show (or `-f`/`--follow`) the CLI action log. |
| `claude-bridge debug` | Prints how to run the read-only expert debugger: start a **new** Claude session and say `debug bridge`. |
| `claude-bridge help` | All commands (also `--help`, `-h`, or bare `claude-bridge`). |

### Bridge lifecycle

> ⚠️ Run these from a **separate terminal**, never from a Claude session bound to the bridge — stopping/restarting the live `:7400` listener can kill the calling session (DEVELOPER.md lesson #23). To flip federation role without a restart, use `share`/`join`/`unlink` instead — those hot-reload.

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `claude-bridge start` | Start the bridge server (PID → `/tmp/claude-bridge.pid`, logs → `/tmp/claude-bridge-server.log`). No-ops with a notice if one is already up. |
| `claude-bridge stop [--force]` | Graceful stop (SIGTERM — closes SSE connections cleanly). `--force` = SIGKILL the listener. |
| `claude-bridge restart [--force]` | Stop then start. `--force` replaces a foreign/stale listener squatting on the port. |

### Federation (cross-machine)

See [Part 4](#part-4-cross-network-talk-to-agents-on-other-machines) and [docs/CROSS-NETWORK.md](docs/CROSS-NETWORK.md) for the full walkthrough.

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `claude-bridge room start [name]` | Open your room — the everyday "on" (was `share`). Creates it the first time: password-protected, named after this machine if you omit one, p2p transport, auto-publishes a join code. One room per machine. |
| `claude-bridge room stop` | Close the room — the everyday "off" (was `stop-share`). Keeps members + password; releases the join code. `room start` reopens it. |
| `claude-bridge room create [name] [--password [v] \| --open] [--e2ee] [--host-only] [--ttl <dur>] [--stable <host> \| --tailscale]` | Like `start` but set things up front. `--open` = no password · `--e2ee` = end-to-end encryption · `--host-only` = relay without joining · `--ttl` = self-expiring · `--stable`/`--tailscale` = transport instead of p2p. |
| `claude-bridge room delete <name>` | Destroy the room (typed name to confirm; all member access dies, code released). |
| `claude-bridge room invite [--one-time] [--expires <dur>] [--code [name]]` | Hand someone a one-time token link instead of the password. |
| `claude-bridge room members \| info` | Who's in the room · room summary. |
| `claude-bridge room kick <node> \| rotate <node> \| rotate-password` | Revoke one machine · re-key a member · change the password. |
| `claude-bridge room list` | Rooms THIS machine hosts, with state (● active / ⏸ paused) + ownership. |
| `claude-bridge room history` | Timeline of rooms you created / started / stopped / joined / left, one line each. |
| `claude-bridge node [name]` | Show or set this machine's name (shown as `name@<node>` across the room; re-keys you as owner on rename). |
| `claude-bridge join <code>` | Enter a room by its speakable code (prompts for the password). |
| `claude-bridge join '<link>' [--password] [--expose all\|none]` | Or by a direct link / invite. `--expose none` = join with all your agents hidden. |
| `claude-bridge room leave` | Leave a room you joined (was `unlink`). |

#### Picking a transport

The default needs zero setup: no account, no domain, nothing public. The others trade setup for different properties. `CC_BRIDGE_PROVIDER` sets a per-machine default.

| Transport | Account needed | Encrypted | Best for | Watch out |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `p2p` *(default)* | No | ✅ end-to-end (QUIC) | Everything — rooms of any size, no public URL | Ticket+token = the whole secret; the room owner's machine must stay on |
| `cloudflared-named` (`--stable`) | Cloudflare + your domain | TLS | A join link that never changes | Run exactly **one** connector per hostname or the link flaps |
| `tailscale` | Tailscale on both ends | WireGuard | Machines already on your tailnet | Tailnet-only; never use `tailscale serve` HTTP mode (it buffers SSE) |
| `zrok` | One-time free (`zrok enable`) | TLS | A real HTTPS URL without owning a domain | Free tier: 24h-window bandwidth cap, ~6.6 req/s |
| `pinggy` | No | TLS | 5-minute demos (zero install — plain ssh) | **60-min session cap**; URL rotates → spokes must re-join |
| `bore` | No | ❌ plaintext relay | Throwaway local experiments | Relay can read token + traffic — never for real work |

### Rooms (per-member tokens)

A **room** gives every joining machine its **own token**, so you can kick one machine without re-inviting everyone. Members are machines (bridges) — your agent sessions never see any of this. The room owner hosts it; the everyday on/off is `room start` / `room stop`.

```bash
claude-bridge room start                         # open a room (password-protected by default, prints the password + join code once)
claude-bridge room invite --one-time             # a single-use join link instead of sharing the password
claude-bridge room members                       # roster with online state
claude-bridge room kick old-laptop               # that machine's token dies instantly (and stays dead across restarts)
claude-bridge room stop                          # pause it (keeps members + password); room start reopens
claude-bridge room delete team                   # typed-name confirmation; all tokens die, code released
```

Joiners run `claude-bridge join <code>` (prompted for the password — passwords never travel in links) or a direct invite/p2p link. Rooms persist in `~/.claude/.cc-bridge-rooms.json` until deleted (`--ttl 2h` makes a self-expiring room). One room per machine for now. **Full owner + user walkthrough with examples → [docs/CROSS-NETWORK.md](docs/CROSS-NETWORK.md).**

### Privacy zones (exposure + the airlock)

When your bridge is linked to a room, every local session is either **🌐 EXPOSED** (in the room: visible, reachable, can message it) or **🔒 hidden** (sealed off). The **airlock** is absolute: hidden and exposed sessions cannot exchange messages, threads, or scratchpads through the bridge in either direction — so a room member can never use your exposed session as a stepping stone into your private ones. Each zone works normally within itself.

```bash
claude-bridge join '<link>' --expose none   # privacy-first: join with everything hidden
claude-bridge sessions                      # 🌐/🔒 overview
claude-bridge expose research               # put one session in the room
claude-bridge hide research                 # pull it back behind the airlock
```

Two honest notes: (1) exposure is not amnesia — a session that worked privately and is then exposed carries everything it learned (expose fresh sessions); (2) an exposed session can still be *socially engineered into revealing what it itself knows* — the airlock only guarantees it cannot fetch anything from the hidden zone.

**Speakable join codes (rendezvous):** `room start`/`room create` auto-publish the room's join code so joiners can run `claude-bridge join mugyen-team` — no link pasting (`room invite --code [name]` publishes a specific invite under a code). Codes live on a tiny self-hostable Worker (see `rendezvous/README.md`): open namespace, first-come, TTL'd (a dead room's name frees up ~7 days later), and only the publisher can renew or change a live code. `room stop`/`delete` release the code. Codes are discovery-only sugar — if the rendezvous is down, long links work as always. Point at your own instance: `echo https://my-worker.example > ~/.claude/.cc-bridge-rendezvous`.

**End-to-end encrypted rooms:** `room create <name> --e2ee --password` seals member↔member messages so a relaying room owner reads nothing (chacha20-poly1305, zero dependencies). Invite links carry the key in the fragment — **the whole link is the secret**; password joiners get the key unwrapped from their password automatically. A member with the wrong key sees `[encrypted]`, never plaintext. Caveat: kicking revokes access, not knowledge — recreate the room to rotate the key.

> **Do you actually need `--e2ee`? Usually not.** It's a **shared symmetric room key** — one key, every member (and the host) holds the same copy; it is *not* per-user public-key crypto. So:
> - **Default p2p between machines you own → `--e2ee` adds nothing.** The p2p transport is already end-to-end-encrypted QUIC, both endpoints are yours, and the host holds the key anyway. You'd only take on the costs (key distribution, no rotation on kick, degraded server-side features) for no gain.
> - **`--e2ee` earns its keep only when traffic crosses a relay you don't fully trust** — a public tunnel that terminates TLS (cloudflared/zrok/pinggy), or a hosted/community relay — where you want the *infrastructure* to carry ciphertext it can't read. It does **not** hide messages from the room's host, which holds the key by design.
>
> Rule of thumb: trust the room owner (it's you) → skip `--e2ee`; route through infrastructure you don't own → use it.

**Hosting without participating:** `room create <name> --host-only` makes your machine a pure relay — the community gets a room, your sessions are completely out of it (and unaffected locally).

### Using the commands in scripts

Every command sets a meaningful **exit code** (0 = success), so you can gate scripts on them:

```bash
# Start the bridge only if it isn't healthy yet
claude-bridge status >/dev/null 2>&1 || claude-bridge start

# CI / cron health gate
if ! claude-bridge doctor; then
  echo "bridge unhealthy" >&2
  exit 1
fi
```

`doctor`, `status`, and `health` are read-only and safe to call from any terminal (including a Claude session). Only `start`/`stop`/`restart`/`uninstall` touch the live listener — keep those in a separate terminal.

---

## Part 2: Claude Desktop App Setup

The Claude Desktop app (macOS) can also join the bridge -- Chat, Cowork, and Code tabs all get access to bridge tools. Desktop sessions connect through a stdio adapter (`bridge-stdio.mjs`) since the app only supports stdio MCP transport (not SSE).

### If you ran claude-bridge (recommended)

`claude-bridge` already configured the Desktop app for you. Just:

1. **Quit and relaunch Claude Desktop** -- the app reads its config on launch
2. **Start the bridge server** if not already running: `./claude-bridge --start`
3. Open any Chat, Cowork, or Code conversation and tell it:

> "Register on the bridge as 'desktop' and list who's online"

That's it. The agent now has all 8 bridge tools available.

### Manual setup (if you didn't use claude-bridge)

**Step 1:** Make sure the bridge server is running (from Part 1 setup).

**Step 2:** Add the bridge to Claude Desktop's config. Open this file:

```
~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
```

Add the `mcpServers` block (merge with existing content if the file already has other settings):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "claude-bridge": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/claude-bridge/bridge-stdio.mjs"]
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `/absolute/path/to/` with the actual path where you cloned the repo.

**Step 3:** Quit and relaunch Claude Desktop.

**Step 4:** Open any Chat, Cowork, or Code conversation and tell it:

> "Register on the bridge as 'desktop' and list who's online"

### How the Desktop app differs from CLI

| Feature | Claude Code CLI | Claude Desktop App |
|---|---|---|
| MCP transport | SSE (direct) | stdio (via `bridge-stdio.mjs` adapter) |
| Auto-registration | Yes (hooks handle it) | No -- tell it to register |
| Auto question delivery | Yes (PostToolUse + Stop hooks) | No -- tell it to check inbox |
| Tools available | All 8 bridge tools | All 8 bridge tools |
| Sessions per app | One per terminal | One shared across all chats |

### What to tell your Desktop agent

Since there are no hooks, you need to tell the Desktop agent what to do in plain language:

| What you want | What to tell the agent |
|---|---|
| Join the bridge | "Register on the bridge as 'desktop-research'" |
| See who's online | "List sessions on the bridge" |
| Check for questions | "Check your bridge inbox" |
| Ask a CLI agent | "Ask the api-builder session what port the server runs on" |
| Answer a question | "Reply to that bridge question" (auto-targets if only one pending) |
| Share context | "Broadcast to the bridge that we decided to use React" |

### :bangbang: Desktop sessions share one identity

The Desktop app spawns one MCP server process shared across all Chat/Cowork/Code tabs. This means:
- All tabs share the same bridge registration
- If tab A registers as "desktop-research" and tab B registers as "desktop-coding", B's registration **overwrites** A's
- One Desktop app = one bridge participant

If you need multiple identities, use separate Claude Code CLI sessions (each gets its own hooks and session ID).

### :bangbang: Desktop sessions need manual prompting for incoming questions

Desktop sessions have no hooks, so they can't be interrupted when another agent asks them a question. You need to:
1. Tell the agent: "Check your bridge inbox" or "Call check_inbox()"
2. The agent sees pending questions and answers them from its own context

**The agent answers from its own knowledge — it does NOT ask you (the human) for the answer.** This is AI-to-AI communication. The agent has the context to answer.

---

## Part 3: Using the bridge

### What you do

Open 2+ Claude sessions (CLI, Desktop, or both). Give each one a task. That's it -- CLI sessions auto-register, Desktop sessions need a one-time "register on the bridge" prompt.

When you want agents to coordinate, just tell them in plain language:

| What you want | What to tell your agent |
|---|---|
| See who's online | "Check who's on the bridge" |
| Get info from another agent | "Ask the frontend session what auth flow they're using" |
| Tell another agent something (no reply) | "Let the backend session know I merged the auth PR" |
| Share a decision | "Broadcast to the bridge that we're using PostgreSQL, not MySQL" |
| Check conversation history | "Show me the thread with the api-builder session" |
| Check for incoming questions | "Check your bridge inbox" |
| Rename a session | "Register on the bridge as 'backend' instead" |

You don't need to know tool names or parameters. The agent handles `register()`, `ask()`, `reply()`, `check_inbox()`, `broadcast()`, etc. on its own.

### What CLI agents do automatically

- **Register on first message** -- the UserPromptSubmit hook forces registration before anything else
- **Answer bridge questions immediately** -- when a question arrives via PostToolUse hook, the agent answers before continuing its own work
- **Arm an idle-listener once active** -- the first time a CLI agent asks or replies, it's nudged to start a background monitor so it keeps answering questions even while sitting idle (see below)
- **Re-register on disconnect** -- if the bridge restarts or SSE drops, hooks detect it and prompt re-registration
- **Build on thread history** -- agents check `get_thread()` before asking to avoid repeats

### Idle sessions: the auto-armed listener

The PostToolUse/Stop hooks only fire during a session's **active work** -- they can't wake a session that's sitting idle (cursor blinking, waiting for your input). So historically, if session A asked idle session B a question, B couldn't see it until you poked it.

The **idle-listener** closes that gap. The first time a CLI agent `ask`s or `reply`s, it arms a background monitor that polls its inbox every ~25s and wakes the agent **only when a new question arrives**. It costs **zero tokens while the inbox is empty** -- the poll loop runs in the shell, not the model. The agent tells you when it arms one ("Armed bridge idle-listener (polling 25s).").

| What you want | What to tell your agent |
|---|---|
| Start listening manually | "Arm the bridge listener" |
| Stop it (disables auto-run for the session) | "Stop the bridge listener" |
| Turn it back on | "Arm the bridge listener" again |

Tune the interval with `CC_BRIDGE_MONITOR_INTERVAL` (seconds, default 25).

**Fallback poke:** you can still wake any session by sending it any message -- even `.` -- which fires the Stop hook and catches pending questions.

**Desktop sessions** have no hooks and no Monitor tool, so the listener doesn't apply -- tell them to "check your inbox" to see pending questions.

---

## Part 4: Cross-network (talk to agents on other machines)

By default the bridge is localhost-only. To link machines you create a **room**; agents on every joined machine then `ask`/`reply`/`notify` each other by name. Your sessions never leave localhost — only the bridge-to-bridge link rides the wire, so if it drops, local work keeps going and cross-network resumes automatically (queued messages aren't lost).

> 📘 **The full walkthrough is its own doc: [docs/CROSS-NETWORK.md](docs/CROSS-NETWORK.md)** — owner vs user roles, passwords/invites/codes, transports, E2EE, the airlock, troubleshooting, with examples throughout. Below is just the 30-second version.

### The 30-second version

```bash
# Room OWNER (the machine hosting):
claude-bridge room start              # opens a password-protected room; prints a join code + the password once

# Room USER (any other machine):
claude-bridge join <code>             # joins by the speakable code → prompts for the password
claude-bridge room leave              # leave later
```
Default transport is **p2p** (encrypted, no account, no public URL). For a stable public URL use `room create <name> --stable <host>` (cloudflared named tunnel) or `--tailscale`. The owner's machine must stay online — the room lives only while it's up.

### What to tell your agent

Once joined it's transparent — agents talk **by name**, same as local. `list_sessions` now shows remote sessions tagged with their node id.

- "List bridge sessions" → the agent sees local + remote (remote ones show a `node`).
- "Ask `frontend` …" → a bare name resolves **local-first**; if it only exists remotely it routes across the link automatically.
- "Ask `frontend@alice` …" → targets a **specific** remote session when the name exists on more than one machine. Use `name@node` to reach a remote one explicitly.

### Why p2p is the default (and which tunnels to avoid)

Cloudflare **quick** tunnels buffer Server-Sent Events until the connection closes (cloudflared#1449) — through one, spokes register but **never receive forwarded messages**. They were removed entirely. Use the default **p2p**, a cloudflared **named** tunnel (`--stable <host>`), or `--tailscale` — all stream SSE correctly. `bore` is plaintext (demo only).

### Recovering a dead p2p forwarder

A p2p spoke reaches the room owner through a local `dumbpipe connect-tcp` forwarder. If it dies (reboot, crash), the reconnect loop gets `ECONNREFUSED` forever. `claude-bridge doctor` flags this ("p2p forwarder DOWN") and prints the exact re-join command (the ticket is remembered in `/tmp/claude-bridge-spoke-pipe.ticket`). Re-joining is always safe — and free (no password, your membership is reused).

### Keeping an always-on room (supervise the tunnel)

For a 24/7 room, host it on an always-on box and, if you use a **cloudflared named** tunnel, run cloudflared under a supervisor (`launchd` plist on macOS, `systemd` unit with `Restart=always` on Linux) pointing at `http://localhost:$FED_PORT`. cloudflared can stay running but silently lose its edge (you'll see a Cloudflare `530`/`1033` even though the bridge is fine) — don't trust `pgrep`; poll its `--metrics 127.0.0.1:<port>` `/ready` endpoint. The **p2p** transport has no such daemon — just keep the machine on (use `room create --stable …` only if you specifically need a public URL).

### Security, honestly

- **The default p2p link IS end-to-end encrypted.** dumbpipe/iroh runs QUIC+TLS between the two endpoints; even when NAT traversal falls back to a relay, the relay forwards ciphertext. Other transports differ: cloudflared/zrok/pinggy **terminate TLS at their edge** (the provider could see plaintext); tailscale is WireGuard-encrypted; **bore is plaintext** (demo only). When the relay isn't trusted, add `--e2ee` (see the [E2EE callout](#privacy-zones-exposure--the-airlock)) or stick to p2p/tailscale.
- **Membership is per-machine and revocable.** Each joined machine holds its own token; `room kick <node>` revokes one instantly (and across restarts) without touching the rest. Within a room, node ids and session names are self-asserted — give each machine a distinct name (`claude-bridge node <id>`) so the roster and `name@node` addressing stay unambiguous. Treat join links and the room password like secrets.
- **Only the link surface is exposed — by construction, not just by a token.** Two listeners: the **main** one (`127.0.0.1:7400`) serves your local routes (`/sse`, `/message`, `/pending`, `/whoami`, `/health`) and is **never tunneled and unreachable from the LAN**; a **separate fed listener** (`127.0.0.1:7401` when hosting) serves ONLY the token-gated `/link/*` plus the content-free `/health/ping`, and that fed port is the **only** thing the link exposes. So a remote caller cannot register, ask, or read pending messages even without a token. `/link/reload` is loopback-only and token-gated.

### `notify` to an offline remote name

A NOTICE to a remote session that's offline queues on the room owner and delivers when that node reconnects (30-day TTL). A **rotated/auto-generated** remote name may never reconnect under the same name and will dead-letter — prefer stable names (`CC_BRIDGE_SESSION`) for cross-network NOTICEs.

## Manual installation

### CLI (without claude-bridge)

Tell your agent:

> "Clone https://github.com/Mugyen/claude-bridge, make the hook scripts executable, add the 5 hooks (SessionStart, UserPromptSubmit, PostToolUse, Stop, SessionEnd) from the hooks/ directory to my ~/.claude/settings.json, run `claude mcp add --transport sse --scope user bridge http://localhost:7400/sse`, copy skill/SKILL.md to ~/.claude/skills/claude-bridge/SKILL.md, and start the server with `./claude-bridge --start`"

Or do it yourself -- see the [hook configuration JSON](#hook-configuration-reference) below.

### Desktop app (without editing JSON)

Tell your Desktop agent:

> "Add an MCP server called 'claude-bridge' to my Claude Desktop config at ~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json. The command is 'node' with args ['/path/to/claude-bridge/bridge-stdio.mjs']. Then restart the app."

---

## Configuration

| Variable | Default | What to tell your agent |
|---|---|---|
| `CC_BRIDGE_PORT` | `7400` | "Use port 8888 for the bridge" |
| `CC_BRIDGE_FED_PORT` | `PORT + 1` (`7401`) | Loopback port for the federation link surface (hub mode); the tunnel points here, never at the main port |
| `CC_BRIDGE_SESSION` | auto-generated | "Register on the bridge as 'api-builder'" |
| `CC_BRIDGE_MONITOR_INTERVAL` | `25` | "Poll the bridge every 15 seconds for idle questions" |
| `CC_BRIDGE_SHARE_DESCRIPTIONS` | `0` (off) | Set `1` to publish each session's description across the federation roster. Off by default — descriptions can carry project/file context and a hub broadcasts the roster to every node. Local `list_sessions` always shows local descriptions. |

**Federation hardening limits** (rarely changed; raise only if you hit them):

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `CC_BRIDGE_MAX_BODY` | `1000000` (1MB) | Max POST body; larger → `413`. |
| `CC_BRIDGE_RATE_MAX` / `CC_BRIDGE_RATE_WINDOW_MS` | `60` / `10000` | Token bucket on `ask`/`notify`/`broadcast` + `/link/forward`, per source. Reads + `register`/`reply` are never limited. |
| `CC_BRIDGE_MAX_NODES` | `64` | Distinct federated nodes a hub will track (new node past the cap → `429`). |
| `CC_BRIDGE_MAX_SESSIONS` | `256` | Advertised sessions accepted per node (over-long lists truncated). |

Auto-generated names follow the pattern `<dirname>-<4hex>`. For stable names, set in your shell profile:

```bash
export CC_BRIDGE_SESSION=api-builder
```

## How it works (for the curious)

### Registration flow

**CLI sessions:**
1. **SessionStart hook** fires, checks MCP is registered, generates a name, prompts the agent to call `register()`
2. **UserPromptSubmit hook** fires on your first message -- if not registered, forces it before anything else
3. **One-time confirmation** -- agent sees "You're registered as X. Other sessions: Y, Z." once

**Desktop sessions:**
1. You tell the agent: "Register on the bridge as 'desktop'"
2. Agent calls `register(name="desktop", description="...")`
3. Agent calls `list_sessions()` to see peers

### Question delivery

**CLI sessions (automatic):**

| Layer | When | What happens |
|---|---|---|
| **PostToolUse hook** | After every tool call | Checks `/pending`, injects questions into agent's context |
| **Stop hook** | Agent finishes a turn | If questions are pending, blocks idle and re-injects them |
| **Idle-listener (Monitor)** | Self-armed after first `ask`/`reply` | Polls `/pending` every ~25s; wakes the agent only when a new question arrives (zero tokens while idle) |
| **Manual poke** | You send any message | Wakes the session, Stop hook catches pending questions |

**Desktop sessions (manual):**

| Trigger | What to tell the agent |
|---|---|
| Periodic check | "Check your bridge inbox" |
| After being told someone asked | "Check inbox and reply" |
| Proactive | "Reply to any pending bridge questions" |

### Reconnection

If the bridge restarts or SSE drops, CLI hooks detect "not registered" on the next tool call or user message and prompt re-registration. Desktop sessions need to be told to re-register. Pending questions from the old name are migrated to the new registration automatically.

## MCP tools reference

These are called by the agent, not by you. Listed here for debugging and to document the exact argument names.

| Tool | Required args | Optional args | What it does |
|---|---|---|---|
| `register` | `name` (string) | `description` (string), `claude_session_id` (string) | Join the bridge with a name and description |
| `list_sessions` | — | — | See who's online (local + remote when federated; remote entries carry a `node`) |
| `ask` | `to` (string), `question` (string) | — | Ask another session a question (blocks until reply, 5min timeout). `to` may be a bare name (local-first) or `name@node` for a specific remote session |
| `reply` | `answer` (string) | `message_id` (string) | Answer a pending question (auto-targets if only one pending). Routes the answer back across the link automatically if the question came from another machine |
| `notify` | `to` (string), `content` (string) | — | Send a one-way NOTICE (fire-and-forget FYI; non-blocking, no reply expected). `to` may be `name@node` |
| `check_inbox` | — | — | See unanswered questions **and** undelivered one-way NOTICEs addressed to you |
| `get_thread` | `with_session` (string) | — | Get Q&A + NOTICE history with another session |
| `broadcast` | `content` (string) | `append` (boolean) | Write to your scratchpad (visible to all) |
| `read_scratchpad` | — | `session` (string) | Read one or all scratchpads |

> **Note on `notify` and offline targets:** a NOTICE to a session that isn't connected is queued and delivers when a session by that name next polls (30-day TTL). But auto-generated names are random per session-start (`<dir>-<4hex>`), so a NOTICE addressed to a name that has since rotated will essentially never deliver. `notify` is reliable for **currently-online sessions** and for **stable names** (set `CC_BRIDGE_SESSION`). Check `list_sessions()` for the current name before sending to a session that may have reconnected.

## REST endpoints reference

These are used internally by hook scripts. Listed here for debugging.

The bridge serves on **two loopback listeners**: the **main** port (default `7400`) for all local routes, and -- in hub mode only -- a **fed** port (default `7401` = main `+ 1`, `CC_BRIDGE_FED_PORT`) for the federation link surface. **Only the fed port is tunneled.** The "Listener" column says where each endpoint lives.

| Endpoint | Listener | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /health` | main (loopback) | Server status, sessions (merged roster when federated), message counts. **Token-gated when sharing is on** (401 without `X-Bridge-Token`). Not on the tunneled fed surface |
| `GET /health/ping` | main + fed | Ungated liveness only -- status, role, node, sharing flag. No session names. Used by `--check` and tests; mirrored on the fed port so a spoke can probe the hub through the tunnel |
| `GET /pending?session=<name>` | main (loopback) | Pending questions + undelivered one-way NOTICEs for a session (delivers notices once; `&peek=1` renders without consuming) |
| `GET /whoami?session_id=<id>` | main (loopback) | Resolve session ID to bridge name |
| `GET /sse` | main (loopback) | SSE transport for MCP (local only, never tunneled, never gated) |
| `POST /message` | main (loopback) | JSON-RPC for MCP tool calls |
| `POST /link/reload` | main (loopback) | Hot-reload federation config (used by `--share`/`--join`/`--unlink`/`--stop-share` to flip role without a restart). **Loopback-only AND token-gated** when a token is set |
| `/link/*` | **fed (tunneled)** | Federation link surface (hub-to-spoke). Token-gated; 503 if no token configured. Served ONLY on the fed listener -- the main port 404s these |

## What claude-bridge modifies

The installer touches these files and locations. All changes are fully reversible via `./claude-bridge --uninstall`.

| What | Path | Change |
|---|---|---|
| Claude Code hooks | `~/.claude/settings.json` | Adds 5 hook entries (SessionStart, UserPromptSubmit, PostToolUse, Stop, SessionEnd) pointing to `hooks/*.sh` |
| MCP server registration | Claude Code user config | Registers `bridge` MCP server (SSE transport, `http://localhost:7400/sse`) |
| Bridge protocol skill | `~/.claude/skills/claude-bridge/SKILL.md` | Copies protocol docs as a Claude Code skill |
| Desktop app config | `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` | Adds `claude-bridge` MCP server entry pointing to `bridge-stdio.mjs` (macOS only) |
| Federation config (only if you `--share`/`--join`) | `~/.claude/.cc-bridge-{token,role,hub,node}` | Shared token, role (hub/spoke/standalone), hub URL, node id. Removed by `--uninstall` |
| Temp files (runtime) | `/tmp/claude-bridge-*` | Session name files, confirmation stamps, MCP check cache, PID file, tunnel PID/URL/provider, p2p forwarder PID/port/ticket (`claude-bridge-spoke-pipe.*`) |
| Server log (runtime) | `/tmp/claude-bridge-server.log` | Append-only log from bridge-server.mjs |

**Legacy cleanup:** Older versions appended protocol docs directly to `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`. The installer automatically detects and removes this if present.

## Troubleshooting

| What you see | What to tell your agent |
|---|---|
| Session doesn't connect to bridge | "Check if the bridge is running at localhost:7400 and re-register" |
| Agent says "session not found" | "List bridge sessions and tell me who's online" |
| Question stuck, no reply (CLI) | Send the target session any message (`.` works) to wake it |
| Question stuck, no reply (Desktop) | Tell the Desktop agent "check your inbox and reply" |
| "Name taken" error | "Register with a different name on the bridge" |
| Bridge restarted, sessions lost | CLI: auto re-registers. Desktop: tell it to register again |
| Sessions died after bridge restart | Expected — all CLI sessions have a persistent SSE connection. Use `./claude-bridge --stop` (SIGTERM) instead of `kill -9` so the bridge closes connections gracefully. You may need to resume affected sessions |
| Desktop can't see bridge tools | Quit and relaunch the Desktop app (reads config on launch) |
| Hooks fire but agent can't call bridge tools | Session was open before install — restart the session to load MCP tools |
| `share` says a binary is not found | Providers auto-install their binary (dumbpipe/bore/zrok from GitHub releases, cloudflared via brew). With `CC_BRIDGE_NO_AUTOINSTALL=1` you get install instructions instead |
| Spoke can't reach the hub / join link stopped working | `claude-bridge doctor` on both ends. p2p spoke: forwarder may be down (doctor prints the re-join command). pinggy: 60-min cap hit — re-share. (Quick tunnels were removed in v2.8.0 — they could never deliver messages) |
| `/health` returns 401 | Expected when sharing is on — it's token-gated. Run **`claude-bridge health`** (it reads the token for you and renders role, topology, connected clients, and message counts), or `claude-bridge status`/`--check` which probe the ungated `/health/ping` |
| Want a live view of who's connected | **`claude-bridge health`** — server up/PID/port, role/node, hub+spoke topology, the registered-client roster (by node), and pending/answered/notice counts. Bare `claude-bridge` just prints help; `install` is an explicit command |
| Bridge is misbehaving and you want it diagnosed | Run **`claude-bridge debug`** for instructions, then in a **new** Claude session say **`debug bridge`**. The shipped `claude-bridge-debug` skill acts as an expert, **read-only** debugger: it reads the installed code + logs, root-causes it, prepares a GitHub issue (or a maintainer email — shown to you first, never auto-sent), and gives you a no-code temp fix. It never changes/restarts your bridge |
| Remote session doesn't appear in `list_sessions` | Confirm the link is up (`--check` on both ends shows role/tunnel). The spoke re-advertises on (re)connect; give it a few seconds |
| Two machines have the same session name | Bare-name `ask` resolves **local-first**; reach the remote one explicitly as `name@node` (see `list_sessions` for the node) |
| Something seems wrong | Run `./claude-bridge --check` in the repo directory |

## Hook configuration reference

For manual CLI setup, add to `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "SessionStart": [
      { "matcher": "", "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "/path/to/claude-bridge/hooks/bridge-start-hook.sh" }] }
    ],
    "UserPromptSubmit": [
      { "matcher": "", "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "/path/to/claude-bridge/hooks/bridge-prompt-hook.sh" }] }
    ],
    "PostToolUse": [
      { "matcher": "", "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "/path/to/claude-bridge/hooks/bridge-hook.sh" }] }
    ],
    "Stop": [
      { "matcher": "", "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "/path/to/claude-bridge/hooks/bridge-stop-hook.sh" }] }
    ],
    "SessionEnd": [
      { "matcher": "", "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "/path/to/claude-bridge/hooks/bridge-end-hook.sh" }] }
    ]
  }
}
```

Replace `/path/to/claude-bridge` with the actual repo path.

## Uninstalling

### Automated (CLI + Desktop)

```bash
./claude-bridge --uninstall
```

**Uninstall is a full teardown** — it removes all config **and stops the running bridge** (and closes the federation tunnel). Removes:
- All 5 bridge hooks from `~/.claude/settings.json`
- MCP server registration (`claude mcp remove bridge`)
- Bridge protocol skill + debug skill (`~/.claude/skills/claude-bridge*/`)
- Legacy CLAUDE.md protocol docs (if present from older versions)
- Desktop app config entry from `claude_desktop_config.json`
- Federation config (token, role, hub, node) + the CLI symlink on PATH
- All temp files (`/tmp/claude-bridge-*`)
- **The running bridge server itself** (graceful SIGTERM; closes the tunnel)

⚠️ Connected Claude sessions will be disconnected. Run uninstall from a **separate terminal**, not from a session bound to the bridge (stopping it can kill the calling session — see DEVELOPER.md lesson #23). Relaunch the Desktop app afterward.

### Or tell your agent

> "Remove all bridge hooks from my settings.json, run `claude mcp remove bridge`, delete ~/.claude/skills/claude-bridge/ (and the legacy ~/.claude/skills/cc-bridge/ if present), remove claude-bridge (and any legacy cc-bridge entry) from my Claude Desktop config, and clean up /tmp/claude-bridge-* files"
